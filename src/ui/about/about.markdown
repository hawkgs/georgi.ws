# About

My name is Georgi (if that's not obvious yet). Here are some key points about me:

- A developer specializing primarily in web and front-end technologies
- Interested in things like design, UX and physics
- A.k.a. "hawk" or "hAWK" in various internet communities
- Freerunner (ex, kind of) and die-hard Subaru fan
- Currently part of [Rhyme](https://rhyme.com)

### The website

During the development of this website I had one rule - don't use libraries apart from Webpack and Babel. This resulted in a small not-so-rich single-page framework. It was purely a test for me, trying to build something without the common and conventional tools and frameworks available nowdays. You can check the whole source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/hawkgs/georgi.ws).
