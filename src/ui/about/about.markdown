- Interested in things like design, UX and physics
- A.k.a. "hawk" or "hAWK" in various internet communities
- Currently part of [This Dot, Inc](https://thisdot.co). Previously, [Rhyme Softworks LLC](https://rhyme.com)

### The website

During the development of this website I had one rule - don't use libraries apart from Webpack and Babel. This resulted in a small not-so-rich single-page framework. It was purely a test for me, trying to build something without the common and conventional tools and frameworks available nowdays. You can check the whole source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/hawkgs/georgi.ws).
