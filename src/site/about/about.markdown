# About

I am a developer specializing primarily in web and front-end technologies, named Georgi. In various internet communities, I am also known as "hawk" or "hAWK". My interests vary from programming, design and drawing to acrobatics and Subarus.

Currently part of [rhyme.com](https://rhyme.com){target="_blank"}

### The website

During the development of this website I had one rule - don't use libraries apart from Webpack and Babel. This resulted in a small not-so-rich framework. It was purely a test for me, trying to build something without the common and conventional tools and frameworks available nowdays. You can check the whole source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/hawkgs/georgi.ws){target="_blank"}.
